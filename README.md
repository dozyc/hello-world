Going through github hello-world tutorial

I'm surprised to see that there is a text editor here in github. I wonder if anyone uses this editor to construct all their code. How far could you get editing your code inside github? At some point it needs to be compiled, so that isn't something github does. Could this be a feature that github is looking at? Actually some code doesn't need to be compiled, for example most webpage content just get viewed by  browser. And there's ways to make github commits go directly to a web server. Interesting...

I wish I had something more to say about this repository. But it really is a purposeless repository, outside the purpose of being an example to work through the tutorial.
